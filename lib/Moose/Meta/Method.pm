=head1 NAME

Moose::Meta::Method - A Moose Method metaclass

=head1 DESCRIPTION

For now, this is nothing but a subclass of Class::MOP::Method, 
but with the expanding role of the method sub-protocol, it might 
be more useful later on. 

=head1 BUGS

All complex software has bugs lurking in it, and this module is no 
exception. If you find a bug please either email me, or add the bug
