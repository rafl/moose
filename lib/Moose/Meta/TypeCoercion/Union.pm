=head1 NAME

Moose::Meta::TypeCoercion::Union - The Moose Type Coercion metaclass for Unions

=head1 DESCRIPTION

For the most part, the only time you will ever encounter an 
instance of this class is if you are doing some serious deep 
introspection. This API should not be considered final, but 
it is B<highly unlikely> that this will matter to a regular 
Moose user.

If you wish to use features at this depth, please come to the 
#moose IRC channel on irc.perl.org and we can talk :)
