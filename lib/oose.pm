=head1 NAME

oose - syntactic sugar to make Moose one-liners easier

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # create a Moose class on the fly ...
  perl -Moose=Foo -e 'has bar => ( is=>q[ro], default => q[baz] ); print Foo->new->bar' # prints baz
  
  # loads an existing class (Moose or non-Moose)
  # and re-"opens" the package definition to make
  # debugging/introspection easier
  perl -Moose=+My::Class -e 'print join ", " => __PACKAGE__->meta->get_method_list' 

=head1 DESCRIPTION

oose.pm is a simple source filter that adds C<package $name; use Moose;> 
to the beginning of your script and was entirely created because typing 
perl -e'package Foo; use Moose; ...' was annoying me.

=head1 INTERFACE 

oose provides exactly one method and it's automatically called by perl:

=over 4

=item B<import($package)>

Pass a package name to import to be used by the source filter.

=back

=head1 DEPENDENCIES

You will need L<Filter::Simple> and eventually L<Moose>

=head1 INCOMPATIBILITIES

None reported. But it is a source filter and might have issues there.

=head1 BUGS

All complex software has bugs lurking in it, and this module is no
exception. If you find a bug please either email me, or add the bug
to cpan-RT.
